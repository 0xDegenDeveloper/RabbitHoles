# RabbitHoles

RabbitHoles (RBITS): A Permanent & Censorship Resistant Discussion Board

## Overview

RabbitHoles (RBITS) is an abstracted ERC-20 contract aiming to offer a permanent and censorship-resistant platform for engaging in discussions.

RBITS enables users to dig holes and burn rabbits, which represent topics of discussion and individual messages respectively.

## Basic Flow

The basic flow of RabbitHoles involves the following steps:

- Alice pays a small fee to dig a hole with the title "SHOWER THOUGHTS".
- As a reward, she is minted some RBITS.
- Since they are ERC-20 tokens, she sends a few to Bob.
- Now that the "SHOWER THOUGHTS" hole is dug, anyone can burn a rabbit inside.
  Bob decides to leave the message,

> Who would have thought that the first shower thought to be immortalized on the blockchain would be about the very concept of storing shower thoughts on the blockchain?"

into the hole, burning some of his RBITS.

- Bob's message is timestamped and stored in the contract.
- Several `#[view]` functions are available keeping the frontend and UX in mind.
  -These user-friendly functions make it easy to query and parse details such as the rabbits within each hole, the holes dug/rabbits burned by each user, the oldest/newest holes/rabbits, etc. This design ensures a smooth and enjoyable experience when interacting with the contracts directly or through the frontend.

## Technical Details

### Holes

- Digging a hole will cost a small fee, something like 0.001Îž. This is the dig fee and is used to disincentive spam and fund future extensions to the project.

- Each dig will mint RBITS to its digger. This is the dig reward and will probably be in the ball park of 20-100 RBITS.

\*\* The exact numbers are still being thought about. Feedback, opinions, and thoughts are appreciated and ecouraged.

- A hole's title, ("SHOWER THOUGHTS"), is stored as a single `felt252`, meaning every title must be 31 characters or fewer in length.

- The dApp will encourage syntax and a guide outlining best practices for digging holes relating to people, dates, events, and more will be released. This, along with a dedicated backend should reduce the chances of similar holes being dug.

### Rabbits

- Messages left (rabbits burned) are stored in a single `LegacyMap<u64, felt252>` data structure.
- Each message occupies a contiguous range of slots based on its length in felts

  - For example, the message Bob burned is 167 characters long. This spans across 6 felts, assuming this is the first rabbit burned, Bob's message will fill slots 0, 1, 2, ..., 5.

- Leaving a rabbit will burn 1.0 RBITS for each `felt252` the message spans.

  - Therefore, Bob's message cost him 6.0 RBITS to burn.

## Current Development Status

### A demo for the project can be found at https://rbits.space.

Current tasks include:

- Finalizing contract design to account for future expansion
- Testing to ensure intended behavior.
- Waiting for the alphaV7 network upgrade to deploy on testnet and connect to the demo site
- Finalizing the frontend to ensure a smooth experience on all devices

### Scarb Commands

The project utilizes Scarb,The following commands are useful for working with the project:

- `scarb build`
- `scarb fmt`

### Activate Environment (awaiting alphav7 upgrade)

- `python3.9 -m venv ~/cairo_venv`
- `source ~/cairo_venv/bin/activate`
- `export STARKNET_NETWORK=alpha-goerli`
- `export STARKNET_WALLET=starkware.starknet.wallets.open_zeppelin.OpenZeppelinAccount`
- `export CAIRO_COMPILER_DIR=~/.cairo/target/release/`
- `export CAIRO_COMPILER_ARGS=--add-pythonic-hints`

### Other commands

- Declare contract class: `starknet declare --contract <path-to.json> --account v0.11.0.2 --network alpha-goerli`
