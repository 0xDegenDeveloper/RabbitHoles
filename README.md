# RabbitHoles

A Permanent & Censorship-Resistant Discussion Board on Starknet

## Overview

RabbitHoles is a decentralized discussion platform built on Starknet using Cairo 1, offering a permanent and censorship-resistant space for open conversations. Each discussion topic, `Hole`, stores messages, `Rabbits` within them. $RBITS, are ERC-20 token facilitating interactions within the platform. A demo can be found at https://rbits.space.

## Basic Flow

- Alice pays a fee to dig a `Hole` with the title: `SHOWER THOUGHTS`, she is minted $RBITS in return
- Alice sends a few $RBITS to Bob
- Bob burns the `Rabbit`:

> Who would have thought that the first shower thought to be immortalized on a blockchain would be about the very concept of storing shower thoughts on a blockchain?"

in the `SHOWER THOUGHTS` `Hole`, costing him some of his $RBITS
